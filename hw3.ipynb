This is necessary because ML algorithms require numeric input, not text\n",

    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you'll carry out hyperparameter optimization for the hyperparameter `C` of SVC RBF classifier. In practice, you'll carry out hyperparameter optimization for all different hyperparameters of the most promising classifiers. For the purpose of this assignment, we'll only do it for the `SVC` classifier with one hyperparameter, namely `C`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Your tasks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each `C` value in the `param_grid` below: \n",
    "    - Create a pipeline object with two steps: preprocessor from 4.4 and `SVC` classifier with the `C` value.\n",
    "    - Carry out 5-fold cross validation with the pipeline.  \n",
    "    - Store the results in `results_dict` and display results as a pandas DataFrame. \n",
    "2. Which hyperparameter value seems to be performing the best? In this assignment, consider the hyperparameter value that gives you the highest cross-validation score as the \"best\" one. Store it in a variable called `best_C`.
